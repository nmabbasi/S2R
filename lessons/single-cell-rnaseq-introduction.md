# Single-cell RNA-seq Analysis: From Raw Data to Biological Insights

![Single-cell RNA-seq Analysis](images/single-cell-analysis.png)

## Introduction to Single-cell RNA-seq

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a revolutionary technology that has fundamentally transformed our understanding of biology. Instead of measuring the average gene expression across millions of cells — like traditional bulk RNA-seq — scRNA-seq allows us to peek inside individual cells and measure their unique molecular signatures.

Think of it this way: if bulk RNA-seq is like listening to a symphony and hearing only the overall sound, single-cell RNA-seq is like having superhuman hearing that can distinguish every individual instrument, every note, and every subtle variation in the performance.

## Why Single-cell Analysis Matters

### The Problem with Bulk RNA-seq

Traditional bulk RNA-seq has been incredibly valuable, but it has a fundamental limitation — it provides an average expression profile across all cells in a sample. This averaging can mask important biological differences and lead to misleading conclusions.

Consider a tissue sample containing:
- 70% cell type A (highly expressing gene X)
- 20% cell type B (not expressing gene X)  
- 10% cell type C (moderately expressing gene X)

Bulk RNA-seq would show moderate expression of gene X across the entire sample, potentially missing the fact that it's specifically and highly expressed in cell type A — information that could be crucial for understanding disease mechanisms or drug targets.

### The Single-cell Revolution

Single-cell RNA-seq overcomes these limitations by revealing:

#### **Cellular Heterogeneity**
Even cells that look identical under a microscope can have dramatically different gene expression profiles. scRNA-seq reveals this hidden diversity, showing us that what we thought was a homogeneous cell population might actually contain multiple distinct subtypes.

#### **Rare Cell Types**
Some of the most important cells in our body — like stem cells or certain immune cells — make up less than 1% of a tissue. Bulk RNA-seq would miss these entirely, but scRNA-seq can identify and characterize these rare but crucial populations.

#### **Dynamic Processes**
Cells are constantly changing — differentiating, responding to stimuli, or transitioning between states. scRNA-seq captures these dynamic processes by revealing cells at different stages of transition.

#### **Spatial Organization**
When combined with spatial techniques, scRNA-seq helps us understand not just what types of cells are present, but how they're organized and how they communicate with each other.

## Key Concepts in Single-cell Analysis

### Cell Types vs. Cell States

Understanding the distinction between cell types and cell states is crucial for interpreting scRNA-seq data:

**Cell Types** are stable, distinct cellular identities defined by:
- Specific transcriptional programs
- Unique functional roles
- Characteristic morphology
- Examples: neurons, T cells, fibroblasts, hepatocytes

**Cell States** are temporary conditions or functional modes within a cell type:
- Activated vs. resting states
- Cell cycle phases
- Stress responses
- Metabolic states

A single cell type can exist in multiple states, and understanding both dimensions is essential for biological interpretation.

### Technical vs. Biological Variation

scRNA-seq data contains two types of variation:

**Technical Variation** comes from the experimental protocol:
- Cell capture efficiency
- Reverse transcription efficiency  
- PCR amplification bias
- Sequencing depth differences

**Biological Variation** reflects real differences between cells:
- Different cell types
- Different cell states
- Genuine biological heterogeneity

A major challenge in scRNA-seq analysis is distinguishing between these two sources of variation and ensuring that biological conclusions aren't driven by technical artifacts.

### The Dropout Problem

One of the unique challenges in scRNA-seq is "dropout" — the failure to detect a gene that is actually expressed in a cell. This happens because:

1. **Low starting material**: Each cell contains only ~10 picograms of RNA
2. **Stochastic sampling**: Not every mRNA molecule gets captured
3. **Technical inefficiencies**: Loss at each step of the protocol

Dropout events can make it appear that genes are not expressed when they actually are, complicating downstream analysis.

## Single-cell Technologies

### Droplet-based Methods

**10x Genomics Chromium** is currently the most popular platform:
- High throughput (thousands of cells per run)
- Relatively low cost per cell
- Good for discovering new cell types
- 3' bias in gene detection

**Drop-seq and inDrop** are academic alternatives with similar principles.

### Plate-based Methods

**Smart-seq2** and **Smart-seq3** offer:
- Full-length transcript coverage
- Higher sensitivity per cell
- Lower throughput
- Higher cost per cell
- Better for detailed characterization of known cell types

### Specialized Methods

- **sci-RNA-seq**: Combinatorial indexing for very high throughput
- **Live-seq**: Analysis of living cells without destruction
- **Spatial transcriptomics**: Combines expression with spatial information

## The scRNA-seq Analysis Workflow

### 1. Quality Control: Separating Good Cells from Bad

The first step in any scRNA-seq analysis is quality control. We need to identify and remove:

**Low-quality cells**:
- Cells with very few detected genes (empty droplets or dying cells)
- Cells with extremely high gene counts (potential doublets)

**High mitochondrial gene expression**:
- Often indicates stressed or dying cells
- Mitochondrial genes are well-captured, so high percentages suggest cytoplasmic RNA loss

```r
# Load libraries
library(Seurat)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Load 10x data
data <- Read10X(data.dir = "filtered_feature_bc_matrix/")
seurat_obj <- CreateSeuratObject(counts = data, project = "scRNA_analysis")

# Calculate QC metrics
seurat_obj[["percent.mt"]] <- PercentageFeatureSet(seurat_obj, pattern = "^MT-")
seurat_obj[["percent.ribo"]] <- PercentageFeatureSet(seurat_obj, pattern = "^RP[SL]")

# Visualize QC metrics
VlnPlot(seurat_obj, features = c("nFeature_RNA", "nCount_RNA", "percent.mt"), ncol = 3)

# Filter cells
seurat_obj <- subset(seurat_obj, subset = nFeature_RNA > 200 & nFeature_RNA < 5000 & percent.mt < 20)
```

### 2. Normalization: Making Cells Comparable

Raw count data needs normalization because:
- Different cells have different sequencing depths
- Technical factors affect capture efficiency
- We want to compare expression levels across cells

**Log-normalization** is the most common approach:
```r
# Normalize data
seurat_obj <- NormalizeData(seurat_obj, normalization.method = "LogNormalize", scale.factor = 10000)
```

**SCTransform** is a newer, more sophisticated method:
```r
# Alternative normalization
seurat_obj <- SCTransform(seurat_obj, vars.to.regress = "percent.mt")
```

### 3. Feature Selection: Finding Informative Genes

Not all genes are equally informative for distinguishing cell types. We identify highly variable genes (HVGs) that show more variation than expected by chance:

```r
# Find variable features
seurat_obj <- FindVariableFeatures(seurat_obj, selection.method = "vst", nfeatures = 2000)

# Plot variable features
top10 <- head(VariableFeatures(seurat_obj), 10)
plot1 <- VariableFeaturePlot(seurat_obj)
plot2 <- LabelPoints(plot = plot1, points = top10, repel = TRUE)
plot2
```

### 4. Scaling and Principal Component Analysis

Before dimensionality reduction, we scale the data to give equal weight to all genes:

```r
# Scale data
all.genes <- rownames(seurat_obj)
seurat_obj <- ScaleData(seurat_obj, features = all.genes)

# Run PCA
seurat_obj <- RunPCA(seurat_obj, features = VariableFeatures(object = seurat_obj))

# Visualize PCA
DimPlot(seurat_obj, reduction = "pca")
VizDimLoadings(seurat_obj, dims = 1:2, reduction = "pca")
```

### 5. Dimensionality Reduction: Visualizing High-dimensional Data

High-dimensional data is hard to visualize and analyze. We use dimensionality reduction techniques to project cells into 2D space while preserving important relationships:

**UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)**:
```r
# Run UMAP
seurat_obj <- RunUMAP(seurat_obj, dims = 1:10)
DimPlot(seurat_obj, reduction = "umap")
```

**t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)**:
```r
# Run t-SNE
seurat_obj <- RunTSNE(seurat_obj, dims = 1:10)
DimPlot(seurat_obj, reduction = "tsne")
```

### 6. Clustering: Identifying Cell Groups

Clustering groups cells with similar expression profiles:

```r
# Find neighbors
seurat_obj <- FindNeighbors(seurat_obj, dims = 1:10)

# Find clusters
seurat_obj <- FindClusters(seurat_obj, resolution = 0.5)

# Visualize clusters
DimPlot(seurat_obj, reduction = "umap", label = TRUE)
```

The `resolution` parameter controls cluster granularity:
- Lower values (0.1-0.3): Fewer, broader clusters
- Higher values (0.8-1.2): More, finer clusters

### 7. Marker Gene Discovery

Once we have clusters, we want to understand what makes each cluster unique:

```r
# Find markers for all clusters
cluster_markers <- FindAllMarkers(seurat_obj, only.pos = TRUE, min.pct = 0.25, logfc.threshold = 0.25)

# View top markers for cluster 0
cluster_markers %>% filter(cluster == 0) %>% head(10)

# Find markers for a specific cluster
cluster0_markers <- FindMarkers(seurat_obj, ident.1 = 0, min.pct = 0.25)

# Visualize marker expression
VlnPlot(seurat_obj, features = c("CD3D", "CD8A", "CD4"))
FeaturePlot(seurat_obj, features = c("CD3D", "CD8A", "CD4"))
```

### 8. Cell Type Annotation

The final step is assigning biological identities to clusters based on marker genes:

```r
# Manual annotation based on known markers
new.cluster.ids <- c("Naive CD4 T", "Memory CD4 T", "CD14+ Mono", "B", "CD8 T", 
                     "FCGR3A+ Mono", "NK", "DC", "Platelet")
names(new.cluster.ids) <- levels(seurat_obj)
seurat_obj <- RenameIdents(seurat_obj, new.cluster.ids)

# Visualize annotated clusters
DimPlot(seurat_obj, reduction = "umap", label = TRUE, pt.size = 0.5) + NoLegend()
```

## Advanced Analysis Techniques

### Trajectory Analysis

Cells don't just exist in discrete states — they transition between them. Trajectory analysis reconstructs these transitions:

```r
# Using Monocle3 for trajectory analysis
library(monocle3)

# Convert Seurat object to Monocle
cds <- as.cell_data_set(seurat_obj)

# Learn trajectory
cds <- learn_graph(cds)

# Plot trajectory
plot_cells(cds, color_cells_by = "cluster", label_groups_by_cluster = FALSE,
           label_leaves = FALSE, label_branch_points = FALSE)
```

### Cell-Cell Communication

Understanding how cells communicate is crucial for understanding tissue function:

```r
# Using CellChat for communication analysis
library(CellChat)

# Create CellChat object
cellchat <- createCellChat(object = seurat_obj, group.by = "ident")

# Identify communication patterns
cellchat <- computeCommunProb(cellchat)
cellchat <- computeCommunProbPathway(cellchat)

# Visualize communication networks
netVisual_aggregate(cellchat, signaling = "CXCL")
```

### Integration Across Datasets

Combining multiple datasets requires careful integration to remove batch effects:

```r
# Integration using Seurat
# Assume we have multiple datasets: obj1, obj2, obj3
obj_list <- list(obj1, obj2, obj3)

# Find integration anchors
anchors <- FindIntegrationAnchors(object.list = obj_list, dims = 1:20)

# Integrate data
integrated <- IntegrateData(anchorset = anchors, dims = 1:20)

# Switch to integrated assay
DefaultAssay(integrated) <- "integrated"

# Run standard workflow
integrated <- ScaleData(integrated)
integrated <- RunPCA(integrated, dims = 1:20)
integrated <- RunUMAP(integrated, dims = 1:20)
```

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Doublets

Sometimes two cells get captured together, creating artificial "cell types":

**Solution**: Use computational doublet detection:
```r
# Using DoubletFinder
library(DoubletFinder)

# Estimate doublet rate (typically 0.8% per 1000 cells)
doublet_rate <- 0.008 * (ncol(seurat_obj) / 1000)

# Run DoubletFinder
seurat_obj <- doubletFinder_v3(seurat_obj, PCs = 1:10, pN = 0.25, pK = 0.09, 
                               nExp = round(doublet_rate * ncol(seurat_obj)))
```

### Challenge 2: Batch Effects

Technical differences between experiments can overshadow biological differences:

**Solution**: Use integration methods or regression:
```r
# Regress out batch effects
seurat_obj <- SCTransform(seurat_obj, vars.to.regress = c("percent.mt", "batch"))
```

### Challenge 3: Cell Cycle Effects

Cells in different phases of the cell cycle can cluster together regardless of cell type:

**Solution**: Score and regress out cell cycle effects:
```r
# Score cell cycle
s.genes <- cc.genes$s.genes
g2m.genes <- cc.genes$g2m.genes
seurat_obj <- CellCycleScoring(seurat_obj, s.features = s.genes, g2m.features = g2m.genes)

# Regress out cell cycle
seurat_obj <- SCTransform(seurat_obj, vars.to.regress = c("S.Score", "G2M.Score"))
```

### Challenge 4: Ambient RNA

RNA from lysed cells can contaminate other droplets:

**Solution**: Use decontamination methods:
```r
# Using SoupX
library(SoupX)

# Create SoupChannel object
sc <- SoupChannel(raw_matrix, filtered_matrix)

# Estimate contamination
sc <- autoEstCont(sc)

# Remove contamination
cleaned_matrix <- adjustCounts(sc)
```

## Interpreting Results: From Clusters to Biology

### Validating Cell Type Annotations

Always validate your annotations:

1. **Check known markers**: Do your clusters express expected markers?
2. **Literature validation**: Are your findings consistent with published studies?
3. **Functional validation**: Do predicted cell types behave as expected?

### Understanding Biological Significance

Ask meaningful biological questions:
- What cell types are present in my tissue?
- How do cell proportions change between conditions?
- What pathways are active in each cell type?
- How do cells communicate with each other?
- What drives cellular transitions?

### Reporting Best Practices

When reporting scRNA-seq results:
- Include QC metrics and filtering criteria
- Report clustering parameters and resolution
- Validate key findings with multiple approaches
- Provide code and data for reproducibility
- Discuss limitations and potential confounders
