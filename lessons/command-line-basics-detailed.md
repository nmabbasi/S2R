# Command Line Mastery: A Detailed Guide for Bioinformatics Beginners

![Command Line Terminal](images/command-line-terminal.png)

## Why the Command Line Matters in Bioinformatics

The command line is like learning to drive a manual transmission car. Sure, automatic is easier to start with, but once you master manual, you have complete control over the machine. In bioinformatics, that control translates to unprecedented power and efficiency.

Here's why every bioinformatician needs command line skills:

- **Processing massive datasets** that would crash graphical programs
- **Automating repetitive tasks** that would take hours manually
- **Connecting tools together** in powerful workflows
- **Working on remote servers** where GUIs aren't available
- **Reproducing analyses** with precise, documented commands

Think of the command line as your Swiss Army knife for biological data — once you master it, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it.

## Getting Started: Your First Commands

### Opening the Terminal

**On macOS**: Press `Cmd + Space`, type "Terminal", and press Enter
**On Linux**: Press `Ctrl + Alt + T` or search for "Terminal"
**On Windows**: Use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) or Git Bash

### Understanding the Prompt

When you open a terminal, you'll see something like:
```bash
username@computer:~$
```

This tells you:
- `username`: Your current user
- `computer`: The machine name
- `~`: Your current location (home directory)
- `$`: You're ready for a command

## Essential Navigation Commands

### Where Am I? (`pwd`)

The `pwd` command (print working directory) tells you exactly where you are in the file system:

```bash
pwd
# Output: /home/username
```

Think of it as your GPS for the file system — you should always know where you are before you start moving around.

### What's Here? (`ls`)

The `ls` command lists the contents of your current directory:

```bash
ls                    # Basic listing
ls -l                 # Long format with details
ls -la                # Include hidden files
ls -lh                # Human-readable file sizes
ls *.fasta            # List only FASTA files
```

**Pro tip**: The `-l` flag shows permissions, file sizes, and modification dates — incredibly useful for troubleshooting.

### Moving Around (`cd`)

The `cd` command (change directory) is your teleportation device:

```bash
cd /path/to/directory  # Go to specific path
cd ..                  # Go up one level
cd ~                   # Go to home directory
cd -                   # Go back to previous directory
cd                     # Also goes to home directory
```

**Navigation shortcuts**:
- `.` means "current directory"
- `..` means "parent directory"
- `~` means "home directory"
- `/` means "root directory"

## File and Directory Operations

### Creating Directories (`mkdir`)

```bash
mkdir project                    # Create single directory
mkdir -p project/data/raw       # Create nested directories
mkdir project_{1..5}            # Create multiple directories
```

The `-p` flag is a lifesaver — it creates parent directories if they don't exist.

### Creating Files (`touch`)

```bash
touch analysis.txt              # Create empty file
touch file1.txt file2.txt      # Create multiple files
touch data/sample_{1..10}.fastq # Create numbered files
```

### Copying Files and Directories (`cp`)

```bash
cp file1.txt file2.txt          # Copy file
cp file1.txt backup/            # Copy to directory
cp -r project/ project_backup/  # Copy directory recursively
cp *.fasta sequences/           # Copy all FASTA files
```

**Important**: Use `-r` (recursive) when copying directories!

### Moving and Renaming (`mv`)

```bash
mv old_name.txt new_name.txt    # Rename file
mv file.txt documents/          # Move file to directory
mv *.fastq raw_data/           # Move all FASTQ files
```

**Caution**: `mv` will overwrite existing files without warning!

### Removing Files and Directories (`rm`)

```bash
rm file.txt                     # Remove file
rm -r directory/                # Remove directory recursively
rm -f file.txt                  # Force removal (no confirmation)
rm *.tmp                        # Remove all temporary files
```

**⚠️ Warning**: There's no "trash" in the command line — deleted files are gone forever!

## Text Processing: The Bioinformatician's Superpower

### Viewing File Contents

#### `cat` - Display entire file
```bash
cat sequences.fasta             # Show entire file
cat file1.txt file2.txt        # Concatenate files
```

#### `head` - Show beginning of file
```bash
head sequences.fasta            # First 10 lines
head -n 20 sequences.fasta      # First 20 lines
head -n 5 *.txt                # First 5 lines of all text files
```

#### `tail` - Show end of file
```bash
tail sequences.fasta            # Last 10 lines
tail -n 20 sequences.fasta      # Last 20 lines
tail -f logfile.txt            # Follow file as it grows
```

#### `less` - Interactive file viewer
```bash
less sequences.fasta            # View file interactively
```

**Navigation in `less`**:
- `Space`: Next page
- `b`: Previous page
- `/pattern`: Search forward
- `q`: Quit

### Searching and Filtering (`grep`)

`grep` is your text-searching superhero:

```bash
grep "ATCG" sequences.fasta      # Find lines containing ATCG
grep -c ">" sequences.fasta      # Count sequence headers
grep -v ">" sequences.fasta      # Show lines NOT containing >
grep -i "error" logfile.txt      # Case-insensitive search
grep -n "pattern" file.txt       # Show line numbers
grep -A 3 -B 3 "pattern" file    # Show 3 lines after and before
```

### Counting Things (`wc`)

```bash
wc file.txt                      # Lines, words, characters
wc -l file.txt                   # Count lines only
wc -w file.txt                   # Count words only
wc -c file.txt                   # Count characters only
```

### Sorting and Uniqueness

#### `sort` - Sort lines
```bash
sort file.txt                    # Sort alphabetically
sort -n numbers.txt              # Sort numerically
sort -r file.txt                 # Reverse sort
sort -k 2 data.txt              # Sort by second column
```

#### `uniq` - Remove duplicates
```bash
uniq file.txt                    # Remove adjacent duplicates
sort file.txt | uniq             # Remove all duplicates
uniq -c file.txt                 # Count occurrences
```

## Bioinformatics-Specific Examples

### Working with FASTA Files

#### Count sequences in a FASTA file
```bash
grep -c ">" sequences.fasta
```

#### Extract sequence headers
```bash
grep ">" sequences.fasta | head -10
```

#### Remove the ">" from headers
```bash
grep ">" sequences.fasta | sed 's/>//'
```

#### Find sequences with specific patterns
```bash
grep -A 1 ">" sequences.fasta | grep "ATGC"
```

### Working with FASTQ Files

#### Count reads in a FASTQ file
```bash
wc -l reads.fastq | awk '{print $1/4}'
```

#### Extract quality scores
```bash
awk 'NR%4==0' reads.fastq | head -10
```

#### Convert FASTQ to FASTA
```bash
awk 'NR%4==1{printf ">%s\n", substr($0,2)} NR%4==2{print}' reads.fastq > sequences.fasta
```

### Working with Tab-Delimited Files

#### View first few columns
```bash
cut -f 1,2,3 data.tsv | head
```

#### Sort by a specific column
```bash
sort -k 3 -n data.tsv           # Sort by 3rd column numerically
```

#### Filter rows based on column values
```bash
awk '$3 > 100' data.tsv         # Show rows where column 3 > 100
```

## Advanced Text Processing with `awk`

`awk` is a powerful programming language built into Unix systems:

### Basic `awk` Patterns

```bash
awk '{print $1}' file.txt        # Print first column
awk '{print $1, $3}' file.txt    # Print columns 1 and 3
awk '{print NF}' file.txt        # Print number of fields
awk '{print NR, $0}' file.txt    # Print line numbers
```

### Conditional Processing

```bash
awk '$3 > 50' data.txt           # Print lines where column 3 > 50
awk '$1 == "gene"' data.txt      # Print lines where column 1 equals "gene"
awk 'length($0) > 80' file.txt   # Print lines longer than 80 characters
```

### Mathematical Operations

```bash
awk '{sum += $2} END {print sum}' numbers.txt    # Sum column 2
awk '{print $1, $2*2}' data.txt                 # Multiply column 2 by 2
awk '{avg = ($2+$3)/2; print $1, avg}' data.txt # Calculate average
```

## Pipes and Redirection: Connecting the Pieces

### Pipes (`|`)

Pipes connect the output of one command to the input of another:

```bash
cat sequences.fasta | grep ">" | wc -l          # Count sequences
ls -l | grep "\.fastq" | wc -l                  # Count FASTQ files
sort data.txt | uniq -c | sort -nr              # Sort, count, sort by count
```

### Redirection

#### Output redirection (`>` and `>>`)
```bash
ls > file_list.txt               # Write output to file (overwrite)
ls >> file_list.txt              # Append output to file
grep "error" log.txt > errors.txt # Save errors to file
```

#### Input redirection (`<`)
```bash
sort < unsorted.txt              # Use file as input
wc -l < sequences.fasta          # Count lines from file
```

### Combining Commands

```bash
# Complex bioinformatics pipeline
cat *.fastq | \
grep -A 1 "^@" | \
grep -v "^@" | \
grep -v "^--" | \
awk 'length($0) > 50' | \
wc -l
```

## File Permissions and Ownership

### Understanding Permissions

When you run `ls -l`, you see something like:
```
-rw-r--r-- 1 user group 1024 Jan 15 10:30 file.txt
```

This breaks down as:
- `-`: File type (- for file, d for directory)
- `rw-r--r--`: Permissions (owner, group, others)
- `1`: Number of links
- `user`: Owner
- `group`: Group
- `1024`: File size
- `Jan 15 10:30`: Last modified
- `file.txt`: Filename

### Permission Types

- `r` (read): Can view file contents
- `w` (write): Can modify file
- `x` (execute): Can run file as program

### Changing Permissions (`chmod`)

```bash
chmod +x script.sh               # Make script executable
chmod 755 script.sh              # rwxr-xr-x
chmod 644 data.txt               # rw-r--r--
chmod -R 755 directory/          # Apply to directory recursively
```

## Process Management

### Viewing Running Processes

```bash
ps                               # Show your processes
ps aux                           # Show all processes
top                              # Interactive process viewer
htop                             # Better interactive viewer (if installed)
```

### Background Processes

```bash
long_command &                   # Run in background
nohup long_command &             # Run in background, ignore hangup
jobs                             # Show background jobs
fg %1                            # Bring job 1 to foreground
bg %1                            # Send job 1 to background
```

### Killing Processes

```bash
kill PID                         # Kill process by ID
kill -9 PID                      # Force kill process
killall process_name             # Kill all processes by name
```

## Working with Compressed Files

### Compression and Decompression

```bash
gzip file.txt                    # Compress file
gunzip file.txt.gz               # Decompress file
tar -czf archive.tar.gz files/   # Create compressed archive
tar -xzf archive.tar.gz          # Extract compressed archive
```

### Working with Compressed Files Directly

```bash
zcat file.txt.gz | head          # View compressed file
zgrep "pattern" file.txt.gz      # Search in compressed file
zless file.txt.gz                # View compressed file interactively
```

## Environment Variables and PATH

### Viewing Environment Variables

```bash
echo $HOME                       # Show home directory
echo $PATH                       # Show executable search path
env                              # Show all environment variables
```

### Setting Environment Variables

```bash
export MYVAR="value"             # Set variable for session
echo 'export MYVAR="value"' >> ~/.bashrc  # Set permanently
```

## Command History and Shortcuts

### History Commands

```bash
history                          # Show command history
!123                             # Run command 123 from history
!!                               # Run last command
!grep                            # Run last command starting with grep
```

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Ctrl+C`: Cancel current command
- `Ctrl+Z`: Suspend current command
- `Ctrl+A`: Go to beginning of line
- `Ctrl+E`: Go to end of line
- `Ctrl+U`: Clear line before cursor
- `Ctrl+K`: Clear line after cursor
- `Tab`: Auto-complete
- `↑/↓`: Navigate command history

## Best Practices for Bioinformatics

### 1. **Organize Your Files**
```bash
project/
├── data/
│   ├── raw/
│   └── processed/
├── scripts/
├── results/
└── docs/
```

### 2. **Use Descriptive Filenames**
```bash
# Good
sample_01_quality_filtered.fastq
alignment_results_2024_01_15.sam

# Bad
file1.txt
output.txt
```

### 3. **Document Your Commands**
```bash
# Keep a log of important commands
echo "$(date): Started quality control" >> analysis.log
fastqc *.fastq >> analysis.log 2>&1
```

### 4. **Test Commands on Small Datasets**
```bash
# Test on first 1000 lines
head -n 1000 large_file.fastq | your_command
```

### 5. **Use Version Control**
```bash
git init                         # Initialize repository
git add script.sh                # Add file to staging
git commit -m "Added QC script"  # Commit changes
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Command Not Found
```bash
which command_name               # Check if command exists
echo $PATH                       # Check search path
```

### Permission Denied
```bash
ls -l file.txt                   # Check permissions
chmod +x script.sh               # Make executable
```

### File Not Found
```bash
ls -la                           # Check if file exists
pwd                              # Verify current directory
```

### Out of Disk Space
```bash
df -h                            # Check disk usage
du -sh *                         # Check directory sizes
```

## Building Your First Bioinformatics Pipeline

Let's put it all together with a simple quality control pipeline:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Quality control pipeline for FASTQ files
# Usage: ./qc_pipeline.sh input_directory output_directory

INPUT_DIR=$1
OUTPUT_DIR=$2

# Create output directory
mkdir -p $OUTPUT_DIR

# Process each FASTQ file
for file in $INPUT_DIR/*.fastq; do
    filename=$(basename "$file" .fastq)
    
    # Count reads
    read_count=$(wc -l < "$file" | awk '{print $1/4}')
    echo "$filename: $read_count reads"
    
    # Check for adapters
    adapter_count=$(grep -c "AGATCGGAAGAG" "$file")
    echo "$filename: $adapter_count potential adapter sequences"
    
    # Calculate average read length
    avg_length=$(awk 'NR%4==2{sum+=length($0); count++} END{print sum/count}' "$file")
    echo "$filename: Average read length = $avg_length"
    
    # Save summary
    echo -e "$filename\t$read_count\t$adapter_count\t$avg_length" >> $OUTPUT_DIR/summary.txt
done

echo "Quality control complete. Results in $OUTPUT_DIR/summary.txt"
```
